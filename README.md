#### What's Seraphic You Ask?
Well, the Oxford Definition for *seraphic* is *`as beautiful, pure, etc. as an angel`* , and that's exactly what I meant to accomplish when I started this rice, A new system free of all the mess of the previous one, I choose Everblush colorscheme, it's minimal yet has all the colors. and as much as I love dark themes, I love colors too, lots and lots of blooming and bright colors, and that's what took this rice into the cute direction, searching for wallpapers I realized this idea of following a theme rather than a colorscheme, I find following a colorscheme difficult and boring, so why not follow a theme, say, "cuteness" rather than a colorscheme, well that's something more fun ! 
I hope you liked this rice and it gave you inspiration to do something of your own <3, if so, don't forget to star this repo! 
Thanks!

 ## 🌈 How to Setup?
I donot recommend anyone to just slap these dotfiles into their ~/.config folder and expect things to work, trust me they won't. if you're an veteran you know what I'm talking about, if you're new, comb through these dotfiles, take some code, some inspiration, try things out and maybe you'll end up making something that's yours! 
I say this because ricing isn't straightforward as just pasting some config files, it's a whole process that takes into account numerous hours and a gazillion dependencies which I've not documented. so simply copy pasting isn't going to work.
However here are some points to take into consideration while combing though these:
1. The Rofi Menu is launched by script in `rofi/launchers/type-3/launcher.sh` , customize it by modifying `style-3.rasi` in the same folder
2. Rofi PowerMenu is launched by script in `rofi/powermenu/type-4/powermenu.sh`, customize it by modifying `style-5.rasi`  in the same folder
3. Spicetify has a Custom Theme that's in `spicetify/Themes/customTheme/` change your config-xpui.ini so.
4. Thank you for looking into this dotfiles, it means a lot to me ;) don't forget to star if you liked my work.
